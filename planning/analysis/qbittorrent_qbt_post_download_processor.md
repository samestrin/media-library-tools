# Technical Analysis: qbittorrent/qbt_post_download_processor

## 1. Complexity Assessment

**Classification: Complex (8+ days)**

This feature represents a complex implementation for several reasons:
- Requires integration with external system (qBittorrent) via command-line interface
- Involves multiple file operations (archive detection, extraction, validation, moving)
- Needs robust error handling and rollback capabilities
- Requires interaction with existing Plex tools
- Must implement safety features like preview mode and space validation
- Cross-platform compatibility considerations for archive handling

## 2. Technical Deep Dive

### Existing Codebase Architecture
The media-library-tools project follows a pattern of self-contained Python scripts using only standard library modules. Each tool is typically a single file with no external dependencies.

Key patterns observed:
- Standard CLI argument parsing with argparse
- Consistent logging and output formatting
- Error handling with try/except blocks
- Use of pathlib for path operations
- Integration with other tools via subprocess calls

### Configuration Variables & Integration Points
- qBittorrent integration: Will receive torrent path, name, and category via command-line arguments
- Plex tools integration: Will need to call existing Plex organization tools via subprocess
- Environment variables: May need to respect system PATH for archive tools (unrar, 7z)
- File system paths: Will work with downloaded torrent directories

### Threading/Concurrency Requirements
- No explicit threading needed as qBittorrent will call this script once per torrent
- However, the script may need to handle concurrent executions if multiple torrents finish simultaneously
- File locking mechanism may be needed to prevent conflicts

### Packaging/Deployment/Platform Needs
- Must be a standalone Python script with no external dependencies
- Should work on Linux, macOS, and Windows (where qBittorrent runs)
- Archive handling tools (unrar, 7z) may need to be installed separately on the system
- Will need to be executable (chmod +x) and in PATH for qBittorrent integration

### Potential Technical Challenges and Risks
1. Cross-platform archive extraction (different tools on different OS)
2. Handling of multi-part archives and nested archives
3. Space validation before extraction (accurate disk space calculation)
4. Rollback mechanism implementation for failed operations
5. Integration with existing Plex tools without breaking changes
6. Proper error handling for all external tool calls

## 3. Dependency Analysis

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing Plex organization tools (plex/ directory)
- Common utility functions that may exist in the codebase
- Test framework in tests/ directory

### External Dependencies
- unrar/unzip/7z tools for archive extraction (system dependencies)
- Python standard library modules only (subprocess, pathlib, argparse, etc.)

### Version Compatibility
- Python 3.7+ (as per project requirements)
- Archive tools versions will vary by system but should use common command-line interfaces

## 4. Implementation Breakdown

### Logical Phases
1. Core script structure and argument parsing
2. Archive detection and extraction logic
3. File validation and space checking
4. File movement and Plex tool integration
5. Safety features (preview mode, rollback)
6. Testing and documentation

### Files to Create vs Modify
- Create: qbittorrent/qbt_post_download_processor.py
- Modify: None (new feature, no existing files to modify)

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual functions (archive detection, path validation)
- Integration tests with sample archives
- Mock tests for Plex tool integration
- Edge case testing (nested archives, permission errors, disk full)

### Error Handling & Edge Cases
- Permission denied errors on file operations
- Insufficient disk space for extraction
- Corrupted or password-protected archives
- Missing archive extraction tools
- Failed Plex tool execution
- Network issues during Plex library refresh

## 5. Architecture Considerations

### Design Patterns
- Strategy pattern for different archive types
- Command pattern for Plex tool execution
- Observer pattern for progress reporting

### Scalability and Maintainability
- Modular design with separate functions for each major operation
- Clear separation of concerns
- Extensible for additional archive types or Plex operations

### Security Implications
- Input validation for paths received from qBittorrent
- Avoiding path traversal vulnerabilities
- Safe subprocess execution

### Performance Requirements
- Efficient disk space calculation
- Progress reporting for long extractions
- Minimal memory usage for large archives
