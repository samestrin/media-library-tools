# Test Suite Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the existing test suites against the fixture strategy defined in `/planning/specifications/fixtures.md` and `tests/fixtures/README.md`. The goal is to identify which tests properly use fixtures and which need updates to align with the fixture-based testing approach.

## Test Files Analysis

  - Uses `copy_fixture('common/image_files')` to test image file validation
  - Uses `copy_fixture('common/subtitle_files')` to test subtitle file validation
  - Tests file validation with actual fixture files rather than hardcoded strings
- **Recommendations**:
  - None - this file is now correctly using the fixture system

### 4. `tests/unit/test_error_handling.py`
- **Status**: ✅ Using fixtures correctly
- **Analysis**:
  - Now inherits from `MediaLibraryTestCase` to get access to fixture methods
  - Uses `copy_fixture('sabnzbd/mixed_environment')` for SABnzbd error scenarios
  - Uses `copy_fixture('common/video_files')` and `copy_fixture('common/image_files')` for Plex error scenarios
  - Replaces manual file creation with fixture-based approaches
  - Tests various error conditions with actual fixture files
- **Recommendations**:
  - None - this file is now correctly using the fixture system

### 5. `tests/unit/test_fixture_examples.py`
- **Status**: ✅ Using fixtures correctly
- **Analysis**:
  - Demonstrates proper usage of `copy_fixture()` method
  - Shows how to use different fixture categories (SABnzbd, Plex, common)
  - Includes examples of dynamic fixture creation
  - Uses proper assertion methods from `MediaLibraryTestCase`
- **Recommendations**:
  - None - this file is already correctly using the fixture system

### 6. `tests/integration/test_workflow.py`
- **Status**: ✅ Using fixtures correctly
- **Analysis**:
  - Now inherits from `MediaLibraryTestCase` to get access to fixture methods
  - Uses existing fixtures from `tests/fixtures/sabnzbd/` and `tests/fixtures/plex/`
  - Replaces references to non-existent fixtures with proper fixture paths:
    - Uses `sabnzbd/mixed_environment` instead of non-existent `sabnzbd/movie_download`
    - Uses actual Plex fixtures for testing workflows
  - Tests complete workflows with realistic fixture data
- **Recommendations**:
  - None - this file is now correctly using the fixture system

### 7. `tests/integration/test_batch_operations.py`
- **Status**: ✅ Using fixtures correctly
- **Analysis**:
  - Now inherits from `MediaLibraryTestCase` to get access to fixture methods
  - Uses fixtures from `tests/fixtures/plex/` directory for batch operations
  - Uses fixtures from `tests/fixtures/sabnzbd/` directory for SABnzbd batch operations
  - Replaces manual directory creation with fixture-based approaches
  - Tests batch operations with actual fixture files
- **Recommendations**:
  - None - this file is now correctly using the fixture system

### 8. `tests/integration/test_error_scenarios.py`
- **Status**: ✅ Using fixtures correctly
- **Analysis**:
  - Now inherits from `MediaLibraryTestCase` to get access to fixture methods
  - Uses fixtures from `tests/fixtures/common/` directory for error scenarios
  - Uses fixtures from `tests/fixtures/sabnzbd/` directory for SABnzbd error scenarios
  - Replaces manual directory creation with fixture-based approaches
  - Tests various error conditions with actual fixture files
- **Recommendations**:
  - None - this file is now correctly using the fixture system

## Implementation Summary

All test files have been updated to properly use the fixture system as defined in `/planning/specifications/fixtures.md`:

- **All test classes now inherit from `MediaLibraryTestCase`** to get access to fixture methods
- **Replaced `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` and manual file creation** with `copy_fixture()` calls
- **Used appropriate fixtures for each test scenario**:
  - SABnzbd tests: `tests/fixtures/sabnzbd/mixed_environment`
  - Plex movie tests: `tests/fixtures/plex/movies/movie_with_extras`
  - Plex TV show tests: `tests/fixtures/plex/tv_shows/unorganized_episodes`
  - File validation tests: `tests/fixtures/common/video_files`, `tests/fixtures/common/audio_files`, etc.
- **Added proper error handling with fixture files** for testing various error conditions
- **Maintained proper cleanup** through the `MediaLibraryTestCase` tearDown mechanism

The fixture-based testing approach provides:
- More realistic test data that mirrors actual usage scenarios
- Better maintainability as fixture data can be updated independently of test code
- Consistent testing patterns across all test files
- Improved test reliability by using actual files rather than mocked data
