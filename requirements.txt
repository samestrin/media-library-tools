# Media Library Tools - Runtime Dependencies
# 
# This project is designed to be completely self-contained with ZERO external dependencies.
# All tools use only Python standard library modules to ensure:
# - No installation or setup required
# - Maximum compatibility across Python environments
# - Zero dependency conflicts
# - Immediate usability after download
#
# Runtime Requirements:
# - Python 3.7+ (uses standard library only)
#
# This file serves as explicit documentation of our zero-dependency principle
# and helps with future-proofing and developer expectations.
#
# For development dependencies (linting, formatting, testing), see pyproject.toml
